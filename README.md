# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to take data from green stocks in 2017 and 2018. I was tasked with analyzing the data provided to determine if the stock is worth investing. While analyzing the data I was also tasked with making the data easier to understand.

## Results
When looking at 2017 the stocks seemed to be great investements. Each stock can be described by one of twelve tickers. If the return was positve the cell pergentage will be green, if not the percentage will be red. As you can see below only one percentage was negative. This is a very different contrast to 2018.

In 2018 only two of the twelve stocks finished positive. As you can see in the stock market there are highs and lows and 2018 was a low year for the green stocks. Although 2018 was a bad year that does not mean 2019 will have the same results.

Looking at this data the time to buy this stock was 2016 and they should have been sold in 2017. For a person looking to invest now or someone who did not sell their shares, I would recommend holding on to them/buying. The price right now is cheap so it is a great time to buy and wait it out for the stocks to rebound. 

### Code Results

In the original code the analysis for 2017 ran in 0.496 seconds and the analysis for 2018 ran in 0.484 seconds. Once I added tickerIndex and wrote everything through different arrays, it cut the analysis time in half.

## Summary

### What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code?

Some advantages to refacotring code are the ability to shrink the amount of code, and perform analysis faster. A disadvantage is the code is harder to read for someone without expereince in coding. A beginner would not be able to look at a refactored code and understand what is happening without a lot of comments explaining the process.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

These pros and cons apply very well to the VBS script because the amount of code is less than the original script, and the analysis performs much faster. On the flip side though the code is harder to understand for a beginner. They would have to ask a lot of questions to the author which is not always possible.
